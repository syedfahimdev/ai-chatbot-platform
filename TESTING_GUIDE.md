# AI Chatbot Testing Guide
Generated by syed

## Quick Test Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Docker Desktop** must be installed and running
2. **Git** must be installed
3. **Valid OpenAI API Key** (for AI chat functionality)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\syedf\Downloads\projects\AI CHATBOT"
   ```

2. Ensure you have the `.env` file (if missing, copy from example):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   - Open `.env` in a text editor
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key

### Step 2: Start the Services

```powershell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will start all services:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- ChromaDB vector database
- Backend API (FastAPI)
- Frontend (React)

### Step 3: Verify Services are Running

```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

All containers should show as "running".

### Step 4: Run Tests

#### Option A: PowerShell Test Script
```powershell
.\test_project.ps1
```

#### Option B: Python Test Script
```powershell
python test_project.py
```

#### Option C: Manual Testing

1. **Check Backend API**:
   - Open browser: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - You should see the Swagger API documentation

2. **Check Frontend**:
   - Open browser: http://localhost:3000
   - You should see the AI Chatbot login page

3. **Test Login**:
   - Customer: `customer@demo.com` / `test123`
   - Admin: `admin@demo.com` / `admin123`
   - Engineer: `engineer@demo.com` / `test123`

4. **Test Chat** (as Customer or Engineer):
   - Click "New Conversation"
   - Type a message like "Hello" or "What services does Everi provide?"
   - You should get an AI response

5. **Test Admin Features** (as Admin):
   - View user management
   - Check document management
   - View analytics dashboard

### Step 5: Troubleshooting

#### If services won't start:
```powershell
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Check specific service
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend

# Restart everything
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Cannot connect to Docker daemon"**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - Restart Docker Desktop

2. **"Port already in use"**
   - Check what's using the ports:
     ```powershell
     netstat -ano | findstr :8000
     netstat -ano | findstr :3000
     ```
   - Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.yml

3. **"Invalid host header" errors**
   - Already fixed in the code (TrustedHostMiddleware commented out)

4. **"Incorrect API key" in chat**
   - Update OPENAI_API_KEY in .env file
   - Restart backend: `docker-compose restart backend`

5. **Database connection errors**
   - Database might need initialization
   - Check PostgreSQL logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`

### Expected Test Results

When all services are running correctly:

✅ **Docker Environment**
- Docker installed and running
- docker-compose.yml exists
- .env file configured

✅ **Services Status**
- All containers running
- Backend accessible at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

✅ **Authentication**
- All three user types can login
- JWT tokens are issued correctly

✅ **Functionality**
- Chat works for Customer and Engineer roles
- Admin can access management features
- AI responses are generated (requires valid OpenAI key)

### Deployment Testing

#### Frontend (Netlify)
1. The project is configured for Netlify deployment
2. `netlify.toml` files are in place
3. To deploy:
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
   - Set base directory to `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`

#### Backend (Production)
Consider these platforms:
- **Railway**: Easy Docker deployment
- **Render**: Free tier available
- **AWS ECS**: For enterprise scale
- **Heroku**: Simple deployment

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected response times (local testing):
- Health check: < 50ms
- Login: < 200ms
- Chat response: 1-3 seconds (depends on OpenAI)
- Frontend load: < 2 seconds

### Security Checklist

✅ JWT authentication implemented
✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
✅ CORS configured
✅ Input validation on all endpoints
✅ SQL injection protection (SQLAlchemy ORM)
✅ Environment variables for secrets

## Summary

The AI Chatbot project includes:
- Multi-role authentication (Admin, Customer, Field Engineer)
- AI-powered chat using OpenAI
- Document management system
- User management for admins
- Modern React frontend
- FastAPI backend with async support
- PostgreSQL + Redis + ChromaDB for data storage
- Docker Compose for easy deployment
- Netlify-ready frontend configuration

All core functionality has been implemented and tested. The project is ready for deployment after ensuring all services are running and the OpenAI API key is configured.
